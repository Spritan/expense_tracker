    https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/48d9fb8c8e287c472af500221c6450ecd45d7d39/google/api/http.proto#L117,
    repeated fields (i.e. list-valued fields) may only contain primitive types (not lists or dicts).
    This is enforced in this function.

    Args:
      obj: a possibly nested dictionary (from json), or None
      strict: a bool, defaulting to False, to enforce that all values in the
              result tuples be strings and, if boolean, lower-cased.

    Returns: a list of tuples, with each tuple having a (possibly) multi-part name
      and a scalar value.

    Raises:
      TypeError if obj is not a dict or None
      ValueError if obj contains a list of non-primitive values.
