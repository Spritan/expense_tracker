        Sets this legend group's title font.

        The 'font' property is an instance of Font
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.box.legendgrouptitle.Font`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Font constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                color

                family
                    HTML font family - the typeface that will be
                    applied by the web browser. The web browser
                    will only be able to apply a font if it is
                    available on the system which it operates.
                    Provide multiple font families, separated by
                    commas, to indicate the preference in which to
                    apply fonts if they aren't available on the
                    system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at
                    https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise)
                    generates images on a server, where only a
                    select number of fonts are installed and
                    supported. These include "Arial", "Balto",
                    "Courier New", "Droid Sans", "Droid Serif",
                    "Droid Sans Mono", "Gravitas One", "Old
                    Standard TT", "Open Sans", "Overpass", "PT Sans
                    Narrow", "Raleway", "Times New Roman".
                lineposition
                    Sets the kind of decoration line(s) with text,
                    such as an "under", "over" or "through" as well
                    as combinations e.g. "under+over", etc.
                shadow
                    Sets the shape and color of the shadow behind
                    text. "auto" places minimal shadow and applies
                    contrast text font color. See
                    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
                    US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow for additional
                    options.
                size

                style
                    Sets whether a font should be styled with a
                    normal or italic face from its family.
                textcase
                    Sets capitalization of text. It can be used to
                    make text appear in all-uppercase or all-
                    lowercase, or with each word capitalized.
                variant
                    Sets the variant of the font.
                weight
                    Sets the weight (or boldness) of the font.
